- link sidebar to a database with corresponding titles
    - separate page with list for each book/author/whatever
- add button on each card for deletion of book (button added, need hookup)
    - add index number onto card that corresponds with it's place in the bookList array
    - on deletion button click, remove that specific index from the array?
- Simplify card creation, use template variable up top instead of long lines of code
