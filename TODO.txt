- reformat Book into class
- turn library into a class?
- initial modal stuff is fine
- make createBookCard into a function instead of the trash I wrote before
- fix how book is stored in library.
- I don't know just basically rewrite the whole JS file because, even though it works, it's confusing and looks like ass
